**** Python Operators ****
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:

Python divides the operators in the following groups:
Arithmetic operators
Assignment operators
Comparison operators
Logical operators
Identity operators
Membership operators
Bitwise operators
"""
#print(10 + 5)

"""
**** Python Arithmetic Operators ****
Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:
"""
# num1 =10
# num2=5 
# print(num1 + num2)
# print(num1 - num2)
# print(num1 * num2)
# print(num1 / num2)
# print(num1 % num2)
# print(num1 ** num2)
# print(num1 // num2)

"""
**** Python Assignment Operators ****
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:
"""
# a =5
#a+=3
# a-=3
# a*=3
# a/=3
# a%=3
# a//=3
# a **= 3
# a &= 3
# a |= 3
# a ^= 3
# a >>= 3
# a <<= 3
# print(a)

"""
**** Python Comparison Operators ****
Comparison operators are used to compare two values:
"""
# x =10
# y =5
# print(x == y)      #Equal
# print(x != y)     #Not equal
# print(x > y)       #Greater than
# print(x < y)        #Less than
# print(x >= y)      #Greater than or equal to
# print(x <= y)        #Less than or equal to

"""
***** Python Logical Operators ****
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:
"""
#x =10
# print(x < 5 and  x < 10) #Returns True if both statements are true
# print(x < 5 or x < 4) #Returns True if one of the statements is true
# print(not(x < 5 and x < 10)) #Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true

"""
**** Python Identity Operators ****
Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:
"""
# x=10
# y =13

# print(x is y) #Returns True if both variables are the same object
# print(x is not y) #	Returns True if both variables are not the same object

"""
**** Python Membership Operators ****
Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object:
"""
# x = ["apple", "banana"]
# print("banana" in x)  #Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object
# print("pineapple" not in x) #Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object

"""
**** Python Bitwise Operators ****
Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers:
&   =>  AND   =>  Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
|   =>  OR    =>	Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
^   =>  XOR   =>	Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
~   =>  NOT   =>  Inverts all the bits
<<  =>  Zero  =>  fill left shift	Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off
>>  =>	Signed right shift  =>	Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off
