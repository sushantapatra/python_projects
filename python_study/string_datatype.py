"""
**** Python Strings ****
Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.
'Hello' or "Hello"

**** Strings are Arrays ****
Square brackets [] can be used to access elements of the string.
Get the character at position 1 (remember that the first character has the position 0):
"""
# name ="Sushanta patra"
# print(name[0])

"""
**** Looping Through a String ****
Since strings are arrays, we can loop through the characters in a string, with a for loop.
"""
# for x in "banana":
#   print(x)

"""
**** String Length ****
To get the length of a string, use the len() function.
"""
# a = "Hello, World!"
# print(len(a))

"""
**** Check String ****
To check if a certain phrase or character is present in a string, we can use the keyword in

"""
# txt = "The best things in life are free!"
# print("free" in txt)

# if "free" in txt:
#   print("Yes, 'free' is present.")

"""
**** Check if NOT ****
To check if a certain phrase or character is NOT present in a string, we can use the keyword not in.
"""
# txt = "The best things in life are free!"
# print("expensive" not in txt)

# if "expensive" not in txt:
#   print("No, 'expensive' is NOT present.")

"""
**** Slicing ****
You can return a range of characters by using the slice syntax.

Specify the start index and the end index, separated by a colon, to return a part of the string.
"""
# b = "Hello, World!"
# print(b[0:5]) #Hello
# print(b[:5]) #Hello
# print(b[2:5]) #llo
# print(b[2:]) #llo, World!
# print(b[-6:-1]) #world
# print(b[:-1]) #Hello, World!

"""
===== Python - Modify Strings =======
**** Upper Case ****
The upper() method returns the string in upper case:
"""
# a = "Hello, World!"
# print(a.upper())

"""
**** Lower Case ****
Whitespace is the space before and/or after the actual text, and very often you want to remove this space.
"""
# a = "Hello, World!"
# print(a.lower()) 

"""
**** Replace String ****
The replace() method replaces a string with another string:
"""
# a = "Hello, World!"
# print(a.replace("H", "J")) # returns Hello, World!

"""
**** Split String ****
The split() method returns a list where the text between the specified separator becomes the list items.
"""
# a = "Hello, World!"
# print(a.split(",")) # returns ['Hello', ' World!']

"""
**** String capitalize() Method ****
The capitalize() method returns a string where the first character is upper case, and the rest is lower case.
"""
# txt = "hello, and welcome to my world."
# x = txt.capitalize()
# print (x)

"""
**** String casefold()() Method ****
The casefold() method returns a string where all the characters are lower case.
"""
# txt = "Hello, And Welcome To My World!"
# x = txt.casefold()
# print (x)

"""
**** String center() Method ****
The center() method will center align the string, using a specified character (space is default) as the fill character.
"""
# txt = "Hello this is string"
# x = txt.center(100)
# print (x)

"""
**** String encode() Method ****
The encode() method encodes the string, using the specified encoding. If no encoding is specified, UTF-8 will be used.
"""
# txt = "My name is StÃ¥le"
# x = txt.encode()
# print (x)

"""
**** String endswith() Method ****
The endswith() method returns True if the string ends with the specified value, otherwise False.
Syntax => string.endswith(value, start, end)
value   =>	    Required. The value to check if the string ends with
start   =>	    Optional. An Integer specifying at which position to start the search
end	    =>      Optional. An Integer specifying at which position to end the search
"""
# txt = "My name is sushanta"
# x = txt.endswith('sushanta') # return true
# y = txt.endswith('sushanta',5,10) #return false
# print (x,y)
"""
**** String find() Method ****
The find() method finds the first occurrence of the specified value.
The find() method returns -1 if the value is not found.
The find() method is almost the same as the index() method, the only difference is that the index() method raises an exception if the value is not found.

Syntax  => string.find(value, start, end)
value   =>	Required. The value to search for
start   =>	Optional. Where to start the search. Default is 0
end     =>	Optional. Where to end the search. Default is to the end of the string
"""
# txt = "Hello, welcome to my world."
# x = txt.find("e")
# print(x)

"""
**** String format() Method ****
The format() method formats the specified value(s) and insert them inside the string's placeholder.
The placeholder is defined using curly brackets: {}. Read more about the placeholders in the Placeholder section below.
The format() method returns the formatted string.

Syntax  =>  string.format(value1, value2...)
value1, value2...	=> Required. One or more values that should be formatted and inserted in the string.
                    => The values are either a list of values separated by commas, a key=value list, or a combination of both.
                    => The values can be of any data type.

**** String index() Method ****
The index() method finds the first occurrence of the specified value.
The index() method raises an exception if the value is not found.
